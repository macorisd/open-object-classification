Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these image segments have clear objects in them based on the descriptions provided. Let me go through each segment one by one and see what each description says.

Segmento 0: This one shows a small dog in motion, probably walking or running. The background isn't visible, focusing just on the dog. It has short fluffy fur and perked ears. That seems clear enough; it's definitely depicting a dog.

Segmento 1: The image is dark and blurred with indistinct details. Not much to go on here, so I think this one doesn't have a clear object.

Segmento 2: The image is rotated, making it hard to see the content properly. Without correct orientation, it's tough to identify any objects, so maybe this should be discarded too.

Segmento 3: This segment is very dark and highly contrasted, with shapes but nothing distinct. Probably no clear object here either.

Segmento 4: Another dark and possibly corrupted image. Doesn't seem like there's a recognizable object.

Segmento 5: Here's a Corgi dog in mid-stride, with one paw up. The background is black, so it's clearly focused on the dog. This definitely has an object—a Corgi dog.

Segmento 6: The image is upside down and rotated, showing what might be a landscape but not clear due to orientation. Without proper rotation, can't identify any specific objects.

Segmento 7: A small dog with fluffy fur, possibly mid-shake or in motion. The background is blurred, but the main focus is on the dog. So this has a clear object too—a small dog.

Segmento 8: This one is low resolution and grayscale, making it hard to see details. It might have an object in the center, but not enough clarity to identify what it is.

So, based on that analysis, the segments with clear objects are Segmentos 0, 5, and 7, all depicting dogs.

The segments with clearly identifiable objects are:

- **Segmento 0**: Small dog (animal/pet)
- **Segmento 5**: Corgi dog (animal/pet)
- **Segmento 7**: Small dog (animal/pet)

These segments each depict a clear and recognizable object, specifically dogs.
