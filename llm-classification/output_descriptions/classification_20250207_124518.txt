Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the user has provided several segment descriptions and wants me to identify which ones have clear objects detected. They mentioned that some might be blurry or confusing, so those should be discarded.

First, I'll go through each segment one by one:

- **Segmento 0**: Describes a small dog in motion with details like short fluffy coat and perked ears. This seems clear enough to identify as having an object (the dog).
  
- **Segmento 1**: It's dark and blurred with indistinct shapes. No specific objects can be made out, so I should exclude this.

- **Segmento 2**: The image is rotated, making it hard to discern content. Without correct orientation, I can't confidently identify an object here.

- **Segmento 3**: Very dark with low contrast and possible shapes but nothing distinct. Exclude as unclear.

- **Segmento 4**: Dark and possibly corrupted or rotated. Again, no clear objects, so exclude.

- **Segmento 5**: Clearly describes a Corgi dog in motion against a black background. This is definiteâ€”object detected.

- **Segmento 6**: Rotated upside down with dark areas that might be foliage but not clear. Exclude due to rotation and lack of clarity.

- **Segmento 7**: A small, fluffy dog mid-motion with a blurred background. Even though it's blurred, the presence of a dog is clear enough.

- **Segmento 8**: Very low resolution and grayscale with an object in the center but not detailed enough. Exclude as unclear.

So after evaluating each segment based on clarity and distinctness, I should list only those that clearly have detectable objects without ambiguity.

Based on the descriptions provided, here are the segments that clearly contain objects:

1. **Segmento 0**: Contains a small dog in mid-motion with clear details.
2. **Segmento 5**: Clearly describes a Corgi dog in motion against a black background.
3. **Segmento 7**: Describes a small, fluffy dog mid-motion with a blurred background.

These segments have clear and distinct objects that can be confidently identified.
